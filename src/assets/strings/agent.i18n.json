        "full": "<p>Carrie constantly stays on top of sophisticated technology which has made her a forerunner in the marketing and selling of real estate, she has it down to a science. Her talents and on-target recommendations are always based on facts, reliable market analysis, and her vast knowledge of real estate and the market. Patient yet persistent, she is also highly detail oriented and a very determined negotiator.</p><p>McCormick is available to clients 24/7. \"I communicate often and educate them on the market,\" she says. \"My clients and I are a team. It is important that we work together to create a successful outcome.\" Selling real estate is about knowing what you are selling and articulating what the value is.  Year after year, that focus has led to her placement in the top 1% for the Chicago Association of Realtors. She has also earned the association's Bronze, Silver and Gold awards and been named a Top Social Media Contributor. Last year, she started a podcast to share tips and market information with her colleagues and clients. \"My job is to provide a perfect real estate experience for my clients. I have built a support system that does just that\".</p><p>Knowing that schools are an important factor when buying or selling a home, she partners with schoolsparrow.com and Chicago School GPS to provide additional resources and tools for clients. She also has an extensive social media following, which results in extra online exposure for photos and videos of her listings. Paired with traditional marketing, it's a winning combination.</p><p>A certified luxury home marketing specialist, McCormick has an eye for design and assists clients with setting the stage to close the transaction. She is also trained in Relocation and is a member of the National Association of Realtors, the Home Builders Association and Luxury Portfolio. Outside of work, she volunteers at Chicago Realtors to the Rescue, an organization that supports animals.</p><p>Prior to joining @properties, Carrie served as National Sales Manager for one of Chicago's largest and well-respected development companies, Centrum Properties. She served as an integral member of the development team, collaborating on product design, development and sales. She was also responsible for implementation of residential marketing and public relations strategies and managing their impact on the company's overall corporate profile.</p><p>If you need help in understanding Chicago's complex and ever-changing real estate market, call Carrie McCormick. She is always available.</p>"

We were outgrowing our condo and looking for a single family home as we are expecting our second child. Our condo had been listed (with a previous agent) for over 6 months, we had limited foot traffic and zero offers. Carrie came in and immediately our sense of hopelessness turned to excitement as we knew we would be selling in the near future. Carrie worked tirelessly to market our unit and she generated a TON of traffic. She found the right buyer in short order and she was able to locate our dream home! We HIGHLY recommend Carrie and our experience was nothing short of ideal. Thanks Carrie and Anne!</p>",
