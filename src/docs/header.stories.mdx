# Header, aka. Title

* **Styles**: There are two styles for the Title: `.title--style-light` and `.title--style-dark`.
  * **Light** has a light background and dark gray (Primary 900) text and graphics (SVGs).
  * **Dark** has a dark background and white text and graphics (SVGs).
* **Animation**:
  * As soon as the page loads, the animation starts.
  * Scrolling should *not* be disabled as the animation plays. The user should be free to scroll down throughout the animation. *Note*: Currently, scrolling is disabled.
  * The background image scales down from 150% to 100% over 10 seconds (timeline 1).
  * Meanwhile (timeline 2), after a delay of 700ms, 
  * The @properties logo fades in over 700ms.
  * The word "love" (or an alternative SVG) writes itself (each letter has its own timing) over approx. 2s.
  * The "presented by" text fades in and slides up over 700ms.
  * The "scroll to continue" text fades in and slides over 700ms.
  * The arrow fades in and slides *down* over 700ms.
  * The arrow moves up and down on an infinite loop.
  * The animation plays once.
* **Accessibility**: When [Reduce Motion](/?path=/docs/style-guide-animation--page#reduce-motion) is on, all animations turn off.

## @properties logo

The logo is horizontally centered and will scale to different screen sizes:

* **Mobile**: logo width is 1/2 of screen width (100% - margin and border)
* **Tablet**: logo width is 1/3 of screen width (100% - margin and border)
* **Desktop**: logo width is 1/4 of screen width (100% - margin and border)

<Preview>
<div className="intro-title w-full">
  <div className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 lg:w-1/4 mx-auto">
    <img src="images/intro/logo-atproperties.svg" alt="@properties" />
  </div>
</div>
</Preview>

## How to configure

Define classes in **src/containers/title.container.vue**. *Note*: 
* This is the only component with CSS defined in a `<style>` tag. Consider making styles external, like all other components.
* This SCSS would benefit from having `@apply` Tailwind classes and `/* CSS equivalent */` comments added.

## Accessibility considerations

Relevant [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/):

* Same guidelines as for [Imagery](/?path=/docs/style-guide-imagery--page).
* Same guidelines as for [Structure](/?path=/docs/style-guide-structure--page).
* Same guidelines as for [Animation](/?path=/docs/style-guide-animation--page).
