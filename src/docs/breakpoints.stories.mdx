# Breakpoints

Mobile vs desktop experiences are defined using the following breakpoints.

* **Small** - screen widths below 768px
* **Medium** - screen widths between 768 and 1279px
* **Large** - screen widths between 1280 and 1919px
* **Extra Large** - screen widths at and above 1920px

## How to configure

Define breakpoints in **tailwind.config.js**. 

<Source language='js' code={dedent`
  screens: {
    sm: '640px',
    md: '768px',
    lg: '1280px',  /* Different from Tailwind's default of 1024px */
    xl: '1920px',  /* Different from Tailwind's default of 1280px */
  },
`} />

Tailwind will apply classes responsively when prefixed with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, and `xl:`. <br />For example, `<p class="text-center lg:text-left">` will center text below 1280px and align text left above 1280px.
