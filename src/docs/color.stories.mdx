# Color

Each brand (i.e., @properties, Ansley, Nest) has a color palette, which includes primary, secondary, neutral, and system colors. 
* **Primary** and **Neutral** colors include low and high contrast colors for text, borders, backgrounds.
* **Secondary** colors are tints and shades of the brand/accent color.
* **System** colors denote states or conditions such as error, alert, success, and interactive.

The DLP page uses only a subset of each brand’s full color palette. 
* 3 general colors: transparent, white, and black
* 4 primary colors for text, borders, and backgrounds
* 1 secondary color for accents
* 1 system color for interactive elements
