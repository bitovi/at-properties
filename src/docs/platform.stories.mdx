# Platform Scale

Designing for different scales requires finding a balance between platform best practices and design system consistency. Here are the ways to ensure that properties can accommodate different environments while still sharing a common design language.

        <h2>Proportions</h2>
        <p>Mobile components are smaller than their desktop counterparts. DLP uses a <strong>1.25:1 scale ratio</strong>. This means that a mobile component is 20% smaller than its desktop counterpart, and a desktop component is 25% larger than its mobile counterpart.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>DLP defines <strong>two type scales</strong> (small, large), one for desktop and one for mobile. Text is shown smaller in the mobile scale than in the desktop scale.</p>

        <h2>Object Styles</h2>
        <p>While the proportions of a component change between desktop and mobile scales, the <strong>border width remains the same</strong> at all times.</p>
