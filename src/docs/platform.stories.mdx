# Platform Scale

Designing for different scales requires finding a balance between platform best practices and design system consistency. Here are the ways to ensure that properties can accommodate different environments while still sharing a common design language.

## Proportions

Mobile components are smaller than their desktop counterparts. DLP uses a 1.25:1 scale ratio. This means that a mobile component is 20% smaller than its desktop counterpart, and a desktop component is 25% larger than its mobile counterpart.

## Borders

While the proportions of a component change between desktop and mobile scales, the border width remains the same at all times.

## Typography

DLP defines two sets of font sizes, one for desktop and one for mobile. Text is shown smaller in the mobile scale than in the desktop scale.
