# Design System

A design system serves the needs of designers and developers building digital products and experiences.

The goals of the design system include improving UI consistency and quality, making the design and development process more efficient and focused, establishing a shared vocabulary between designer and developer, and providing clear, discoverable guidance around design and development best practices.

## Guiding Principles

* **Consistent**. Every element and component was designed to work together for an elegant and cohesive experience.
* **Flexible**. The system’s modular design ensures maximum flexibility. Agents and agencies may customize pages without compromising aesthetics. Good design is “baked in.”
* **Inclusive**. Components were designed and built to be accessible to all, regardless of ability or situation.
