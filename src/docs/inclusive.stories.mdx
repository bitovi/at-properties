# Inclusive Design

Inclusive or universal design means creating products and experiences that are accessible and usable by as many people as possible regardless of their differences (e.g., age, gender, physical or cognitive ability, ethnicity, social class, etc.).

Whenever possible, this design system includes relevant [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) on Foundation and Component pages to encourage consideration of accessibility issues. However, some guidelines (e.g., keyboard operability, timing) are not topic or component-specific. To prevent these guidelines from being overlooked, they are listed below as additional considerations.

## Accessibility considerations

Additional [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/):

* Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. [1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#sensory-characteristics)

**Keyboard Operability**

* All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. [2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard)
* If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. [2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#no-keyboard-trap)
* All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. [2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exceptions) (Level AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard-no-exception)
* If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true: 1) Turn off: A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; 2) Remap: A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt); 3) Active only on focus: The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus. [2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#character-key-shortcuts)
