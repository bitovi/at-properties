# Inclusive Design

Inclusive or universal design means creating products and experiences that are accessible and usable by as many people as possible regardless of their differences (e.g., age, gender, physical or cognitive ability, ethnicity, social class, etc.).

Whenever possible, this design system includes relevant [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) to encourage consideration of accessibility issues. However, some guidelines (e.g., keyboard operability, timing, reflow) are not topic or component specific. To prevent these guidelines from being overlooked, they are listed below as additional considerations.

## Accessibility considerations

Additional [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/):

* [1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#sensory-characteristics)<br />
  Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound. 

**Keyboard Operability**

* [2.1.1 Keyboard (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard)<br />
  All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. 
* [2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#no-keyboard-trap)<br />
  If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away. 
* [2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exceptions) (Level AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard-no-exception)<br />
  All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes. 
* [2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#character-key-shortcuts)<br />
  If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true: 
  * Turn off: A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; 
  * Remap: A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt); 
  * Active only on focus: The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus. 

**Valid Code**

* [4.1.1 Parsing (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#parsing)<br />
  In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.

**Semantic Structure**

* [4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#name-role-value)<br />
  For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.
