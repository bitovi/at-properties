## Accessibility considerations

Relevant [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/):

* For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually. [2.5.3 Label in Name (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#label-in-name)
* The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels except when: 1) Equivalent: The target is available through an equivalent link or control on the same page that is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels; 2) Inline: The target is in a sentence or block of text; 3) User Agent Control: The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author; 4) Essential: A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed. [2.5.5 Target Size (Level AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#target-size)
* When any user interface component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context. [3.2.1 On Focus (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#on-focus)
* Labels or instructions are provided when content requires user input. [3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)<](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#labels-or-instructions)
