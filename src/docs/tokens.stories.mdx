# Design Tokens

Design tokens are all the values (e.g., color, typography, object styles, spacing, animation, etc.) needed to construct and maintain a design system represented as data/variables. These can represent anything defined by design: a color as an RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.

The following types of design tokens are the building blocks that make up the DLP design language:

<div className="pt-8 grid grid-cols-3 gap-x-10 gap-y-16 justify-items-stretch">
    <div className="col-span-2">
        <h2>Global</h2>
        <p>Global tokens are the primitive values in our design language, represented by context-agnostic names. Our color palette, animation, typography, and dimension values are all recorded as global tokens. These can be directly used and are inherited by all other token types.</p>
        <p>Global tokens are derived from <strong>Figma</strong> and defined in <strong>tailwind.config.js</strong>. See Tailwind's <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#configuration-reference">theme configuration reference</a> for a complete list of keys (i.e., tokens).</p>

    <div className="border border-primary-100 p-4">
        <p><code>#1B1D1F</code> &rarr;</p>
        <p><code>primary-100</code></p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-span-2">
        <h2>Alias</h2>
        <p>Alias tokens relate to a specific context or abstraction. Aliases help communicate the intended purpose of a token, and are effective when a value with a single intent will appear in multiple places.</p>
        <p>Alias tokens are created by <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration">Tailwind CSS</a>. For example, theme colors are used to generate classes for text, background, and border colors.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="border border-primary-100 p-4">
        <p><code>#1B1D1F</code> &rarr;</p>
        <p><code>primary-100</code> &rarr;</p>
        <p><code>.bg-primary-100</code></p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-span-2">
        <h2>Component-specific</h2>
        <p>Component-specific tokens are an exhaustive representation of every value associated with a component. They often inherit from alias tokens, but are named in a way that allows developers to be as specific as possible in applying tokens to components.</p>
        <p>Component tokens are written by developers and reside in <strong>xxxxxx.styles.scss</strong> files.</p>
