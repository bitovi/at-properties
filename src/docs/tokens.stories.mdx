# Design Tokens

Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system — spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.

Design tokens are directly integrated into our component libraries and UI kits. They cover the various options of platform scales, color themes, component states, and more.

## Types

The following types of design tokens are the building blocks and design decisions that make up the DLP design language:

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-x-10 gap-y-16">
    <div class="col-span-2">
        <h3>Global</h3>
        <p>Global tokens are the primitive values in our design language, represented by context-agnostic names. Our color palette, animation, typography, and dimension values are all recorded as global tokens. These can be directly used, and are inherited by all other token types.</p>
        <p>Global tokens are defined in tailwind.config.js. See the theme configuration reference for a complete list of keys (i.e., tokens).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>asdf</p>
    </div>
