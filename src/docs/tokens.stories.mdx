# Design Tokens

Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system — spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.

Design tokens are directly integrated into our component libraries and UI kits. They cover the various options of platform scales, color themes, component states, and more.

The following types of design tokens are the building blocks and design decisions that make up the DLP design language:

<div class="pt-8 grid grid-cols-3 gap-x-10 gap-y-16 justify-items-stretch">
    <div class="col-span-2">
        <h2>Global</h2>
        <p>Global tokens are the primitive values in our design language, represented by context-agnostic names. Our color palette, animation, typography, and dimension values are all recorded as global tokens. These can be directly used, and are inherited by all other token types.</p>
        <p>Global tokens are derived from <strong>Figma</strong> and defined in <strong>tailwind.config.js</strong>. See the <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#configuration-reference">theme configuration reference</a> for a complete list of keys (i.e., tokens).</p>

    <div class="border border-solid border-primary-100 p-4">
        <p><code>#1B1D1F</code> &rarr;</p>
        <p><code>primary-100</code></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-2">
        <h2>Alias</h2>
        <p>Alias tokens relate to a specific context or abstraction. Aliases help communicate the intended purpose of a token, and are effective when a value with a single intent will appear in multiple places.</p>
        <p>Alias tokens are created by <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration">Tailwind CSS</a>. For example, theme colors are used to generate classes for text, background, and border colors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="border border-solid border-primary-100 p-4">
        <p><code>#1B1D1F</code> &rarr;</p>
        <p><code>primary-100</code> &rarr;</p>
        <p><code>.bg-primary-100</code></p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-span-2">
        <h2>Component-specific</h2>
        <p>Component-specific tokens are an exhaustive representation of every value associated with a component. They often inherit from alias tokens, but are named in a way that allows engineering teams to be as specific as possible in applying tokens in component development.</p>
        <p>Component tokens are written by developers and reside in <strong>xxxxxx.styles.scss</strong> files.</p>
