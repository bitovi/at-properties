## About DLP

DLP stands for **Digital Listing Presentation** or Page (aka. showcase UI). DLP pages are created by real estate agents for individual prospective clients to showcase their agency and expertise. DLP is also the name of the design system for these pages. The system consists of working code, design tools and resources, and guidelines.

## Goals

The goals of the design system are to:

* Improve UI consistency and quality
* Make the design and development process more efficient and focused
* Establish a shared vocabulary between designer and developer
* Provide clear guidance around design and development best practices
* Design and build components to be accessible to all, regardless of ability or situation
* Use a modular design that offers flexibility without compromising aesthetics

## Front-end stack

DLP uses the following tools and resources:

* **Figma** is the design application used to create comps and define overall design (i.e., color, typography, spacing).
* **Typography.com** is the cloud service serving the fonts.
* **Tailwind CSS** is the CSS framework used to style the appearance of the page. Design tokens in Figma are translated into Tailwind variables. Additional classes are written in **Sass** (SCSS).
* **Vue** is the lightweight JavaScript framework used to render components.
* **GreenSock** (GSAP) is a JavaScript library used for animation.
* **Laravel Blade** is the PHP framework and template engine. 
* **Storybook** is the JavaScript library used to create a living style guide and pattern library.
* **Git** is used for version control.
