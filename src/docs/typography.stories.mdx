# Typography

## Fonts

Each brand (i.e., @properties, Ansley, Nest) has primary and secondary fonts. 
* The **primary** font is used for body copy and some headings. It is the most prevalent font on screen.
* The **secondary** font is used as an accent, to bring more emphasis to some areas of the screen.

## Font Sizes 

Tailwind CSS uses 10 font sizes ranging from `xs` to `6xl`.

<Typeset fontSizes={['12px', '14px', '16px', '20px', '24px', '28px', '34px', '39px', '42px', '60px']} sampleText="Award-winning marketing materials" />
