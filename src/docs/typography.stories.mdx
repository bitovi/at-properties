# Typography

**Gotham HTF** is the font used for all text. 
* **Gotham Light** is the primary typeface used for body copy and some headings. It is the most prevalent font on screen.
* **Gotham Medium** is the secondary typeface used as an accent, to bring more emphasis to some areas of the screen.

<Canvas>
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 text-2xl">
  <div class="font-primary">Gotham Light is the primary font.</div>
  <div class="font-secondary">Gotham Medium is the secondary font.</div>
</div>
</Canvas>

## Type scale

Two type scales are used. 
* **Small** for screens less than 1280px wide (mobile)
* **Large** for screens 1280px and wider (desktop)

## Line height and letter spacing

Line height and letter spacing are defined at the component level. Please see individual components.

## How to configure

Include the `<link>` for typography.com in the `<head>` of **public/index.html**.

<Source language='html' code={dedent`
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cloud.typography.com/7735636/6090192/css/fonts.css" />
`} />

Define font families and sizes in **tailwind.config.js**. Tailwind will generate classes for `.text-{family}` and `.text-{size}`.

<Source language='js' code={dedent`
  fontFamily: {
    'default':   '"Gotham A", "Gotham B", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif',
  },
  fontSize: {
    'xs':   '12px',
    'sm':   '14px',
    'base': '16px',
    'lg':   '20px',
    'xl':   '24px',
    '2xl':  '28px',
    '3xl':  '34px',
    '4xl':  '39px',
    '5xl':  '42px',
    '6xl':  '60px'
  },
`} />

Define classes in **src/assets/type.styles.scss**. The classes below apply Tailwind's <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-weight">font weight classes</a>: `.font-{weight}`.

<Source language='css' code={dedent`
  .font-primary {
    @apply font-light;   /* 300 */
  }
  .font-secondary {
    @apply font-medium;  /* 500 */
  }
`} />
