  If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.
* [1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio (Level AAA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#low-or-no-background-audio)<br />

  * No Background: The audio does not contain background sounds.
  * Turn Off: The background sounds can be turned off.
  * 20 dB: The background sounds are at least 20 decibels lower than the foreground speech content, with the exception of occasional sounds that last for only one or two seconds. Per the definition of "decibel," background sound that meets this requirement will be approximately four times quieter than the foreground speech content.
