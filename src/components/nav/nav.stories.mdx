# Navigation

* The navbar is stuck to the bottom of the screen.
* It sits on top of everything except the [Header](/?path=/docs/pattern-library-containers-header--page) and [Modals](/?path=/docs/pattern-library-containers-modal--page). See [Layers](/?path=/docs/style-guide-structure--page#layers).
* It has a double (1px -- 2px space -- 1px) light gray (Primary 200) border on top and a 1px solid light gray (Primary 200) border between the logo | nav items | contact me.
* Links for up to 5 sections are listed as nav items.
* **Spacing**: There is 32px between nav items.
* The @properties logo links to the top of the page.
* The desktop menu appears at 1280px.
* The mobile menu slides up. When a user clicks a link, the menu items disapper, but the mobile menu does not slide down until after that section has been scrolled into view (to avoid having the user see scrolling content).
* Contact Me launches a [Modal](/?path=/docs/pattern-library-containers-modal--page).
* **Accessibility**: When [Reduce Motion](/?path=/docs/style-guide-animation--page#reduce-motion) is on, all animations turn off.

## @properties logo

* The logo is 103px wide at all screen sizes.

## How to configure

Define classes in **src/components/nav/nav.styles.scss**. <br />
*Note*: This SCSS would benefit from having `@apply` Tailwind classes and `/* CSS equivalent */` comments added.

## Accessibility considerations

Relevant [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/):

* [2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-visible)<br />
  Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.
* [3.2.1 On Focus (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#on-focus)<br />
  When any user interface component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context. 
* [3.2.3 Consistent Navigation (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#consistent-navigation)<br />
  Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.
