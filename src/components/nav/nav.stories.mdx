# Navigation

## How to configure

Define classes in **src/components/nav/nav.styles.scss**.

<Source language='scss' code={dedent`
  .class { }
`} />

## Accessibility considerations

Relevant [WCAG 2.1 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/):

* [2.4.7 Focus Visible (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-visible)<br />
  Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.
* [3.2.1 On Focus (Level A)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#on-focus)<br />
  When any user interface component receives focus, it does not initiate a change of context. 
* [3.2.3 Consistent Navigation (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#consistent-navigation)<br />
  Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.
